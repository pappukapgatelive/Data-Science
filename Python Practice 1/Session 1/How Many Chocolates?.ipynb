    "Sanjay loves chocolates. He goes to a shop to buy his favourite chocolate. There he notices there is an offer going on, upon bringing 3 wrappers of the same chocolate, you will get new chocolate for free. If Sanjay has m Rupees. How many chocolates will he be able to eat if each chocolate costs c Rupees?\n",

Now if you were to write a code for m, c and r,  that doesn't seem like a big problem now does it?\n",
